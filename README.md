# Whether-Prediction
 This project predicts tomorrow's temperature using historical weather data. We download a dataset, customize it for our location, clean the data, and prepare it for machine learning. We build a system for historical predictions and enhance the model by adding more predictors. Finally, we learn how to make accurate next-day temperature predictions.

We get our data set from-:  https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search
